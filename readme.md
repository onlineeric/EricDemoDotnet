# Eric's C# Minimal API and Controller Based API Demo Project

Welcome! This repository is a personal project, where I, Eric Cheng, am demonstrating my C# knowledge and the Minimal API and Controller Based API concepts.

## Project Description

This project serves as a demonstration of my C# knowledge and its API development paradigms. I use it to explore various features and concepts in C# programming and API development.

## Goals

1. Demonstrate my C# knowledge.
2. Demonstrate both Minimal API and Controller Based API.
3. Demonstrate CICD pipeline setup with Github Actions, Docker Hub and Azure Web App.
4. Keep it as a simple reference for my personal use.

## Project Ambition

Beyond this C# implementation, my overarching objective is to create a multi-language demo project that showcases my knowledge and skills. I plan to replicate this project in Go and Rust to demonstrate proficiency across these platforms. Furthermore, I intend to develop a corresponding user interface using ReactJS, thus highlighting my front-end development capabilities as well.
