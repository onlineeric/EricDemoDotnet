# Eric's C# Minimal API and Controller Based API Demo Project

Welcome! I'm Eric Cheng, and this repository is one of my personal demo project to showcase my full stack and AI development skills.

## Project Description

This project serves as a demonstration of my C# knowledge and its API development paradigms. I use it to explore various features and concepts in C# programming and API development.

## Demo Site

You can view [My Demo Website](https://agreeable-water-061d90800.5.azurestaticapps.net) built using React, connected to this API backend  

## Goals

1. Demonstrate my C# knowledge.
2. Demonstrate both Minimal API and Controller Based API.
3. Demonstrate CICD pipeline setup with Github Actions, Docker Hub and Azure Web App.
4. Keep it as a simple reference for my personal use.

## Project Ambition

Beyond this C# implementation, my overarching objective is to create a multi-language demo project that showcases my knowledge and skills. I have created a similar project in GoLang, [My Demo Website](https://agreeable-water-061d90800.5.azurestaticapps.net) is connected to both the C# and GoLang backend.
